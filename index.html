		<br>  <cite>  Naming is one of the most fundamental and important parts of developer activities...<br>
( about css position ) <br>
But the main difference is that using relative will now  unlock  the other CSS layout properties. <br>

Tink about it this way: you are setting the element to be positioned relative to other elements on the page. <br>
(about css in general) <br>		  

Let’s see what this looks like, and adjust our CSS like this. <br>
("What is it?" — menu or button), not its state ("What does it look like?" — red or big).  </cite> </p>

<pre> Caught in my mirror, the sun
Stares with his one crazy eye
From a burning blue sky
And we walked on and on
Darling you turned 21
Trying to get everything done
Out in the distance the haze
And the long summer days
And they beat like a drum
Darling you turned 21
All that, this heart of mine
Could never maintain
It felt like it never would change
Then I was alone in your room
You'd been out spending my time
Where the flowers of crime
Hide away in the gloom
And I's just left thinking of you
You got back, and I just sat
Why you lied in my face
Looking back, on a world turned to waste
Now that it's over and gone
I get a picture of you
On some broad avenue
With the night coming on
Darling you turned 21
